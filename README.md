Data Cube moving window operations with YAXArrays.jl - a demo

The Jupyter notebook [moving_windows_demo_julia.ipynb](/moving_windows_demo_julia.ipynb) illustrates how to use the `mapCube` and `MovingWindow` functions from [YAXArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDataCubes/YAXArrays.jl) to do moving windows operations on a data cube.
